# Transpense

Transpense is a web application designed to address transparency in budgeting and communication, inspired by the Hack Foundation's problem statement. Our goal is to provide transparency in the budgeting process of non-profit organizations (NPOs). Additionally, we've integrated Vespa.ai to enable users to search through text data from previously uploaded meeting conversations, promoting transparency within team discussions.
